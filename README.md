# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, we expect you have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

- [Installing JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/installation.html)

# Installation

## With Yarn

To install this module:

```bash
yarn global add generator-jhipster-database-backup
```

To update this module:

```bash
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster-database-backup
```

## With NPM

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-database-backup
```

To update this module:

```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-database-backup
```

# Usage

First, you have to run the generator using the following command :

```bash
yo jhipster-database-backup
```

Then enter the required parameter (backup frequency), don't forget the whitespace if you are using CRON (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

Now a 'backup-<database-name>.yml' file has been created in the following folder : src/main/docker

This service will periodically backup your database.

Then start your database
Your database should be initialized and started in a docker image using the '<database>.yml' file located in 'src/main/docker'.
```bash
sudo docker-compose -f <database-name>.yml up
```
If the database failed to start, you should check if the port is free (for example 'sudo service mysql stop' to stop the default mysql service).

Finally, start the backup service :

```bash
sudo docker-compose -f backup-<database-name>.yml up
```

You will find your backups in the backup folder located in : src/main/docker
